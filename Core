Hello! It was a pleasure doing business with you! I just left positive feedback on our transaction and I hope you can take a minute and do the same if you haven’t already.

Also since you have some interest in hobby cards, it would mean a ton to me if you checked out my YouTube channel! We do box breaks, pack battles, and just have a good time talking cards. https://youtube.com/c/CLECardGuys

Thank you again for a great transaction!

The date range in your account is the most accurate we can provide at this time. Once a VIN is assigned we can speak to more specific dates.

Hello ___, this is Josh with Tesla service. Sounds like the window has lost calibration. Please try this procedure and let us know if it resolves your concern. 1.Enter the vehicle and close the door. 2.Lower the window fully, and continue to hold the window switch down for 2 seconds after the window stops. 3.Raise the window fully, and continue to hold the window switch up for 5 seconds after the window stops. 4.Press the window switch down to the second position to activate the auto-lower function. If the window lowers completely, the regulator is properly calibrated. Please let us know if this helps, thanks!

Hello, this is the Tesla Virtual Service team.

At this time, because no technician is needed on-site (fix will be over-the-air), we would like to document and close out your appointment. Thank you and have a great day.

Hello ___, it's Josh from Tesla service. We're working on preparing for your upcoming appointment and all that populated on our end was getting your tires checked out. Is there anything else you want addressed during this visit?

Hello ___, to start remotely diagnosing your vehicle we need some additional information, please provide us with the most recent date and time of when you last drove the car and experienced this issue. This way we can check the vehicle vitals to see what is going on. Please refrain from using "all the time" or "every time" as we do not know when you last drove the car. As an example: 8th at 10:53am, once we have this information we can start remotely diagnosing your concern, and decide what next steps are needed. Thank you - Josh
